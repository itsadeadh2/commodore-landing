# Introduction


## Why?

I created **[Commodore Landing](https://itsadeadh2.com)** to serve as my personal portfolio and to host my
pet projects. As a backend developer, it is often challenging to showcase skills in an engaging way similar
to frontend developers. **[Commodore Landing](https://itsadeadh2.com)** aims to bridge that gap..

## How does it work?

The **[Commodore Landing](https://itsadeadh2.com)** project is a React app that serves as a landing page for 
my personal website (https://itsadeadh2.com).
  
**However**, it is also part of a larger microservices architecture that hosts many other apps. While "Commodore Landing"
refers to this specific project, I also use the term to describe the entire microservices architecture.
